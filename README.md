# GDFormatter Plugin

This plugin allows to automatically format code in godot using [GDToolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit).

## Installation

### Method 1

Head over to the release section and download the formatter.zip folder and extract it into your project's `addons` folder.

### Method 2

Download this repo and copy the `addons/formatter` folder to your project's `addons` folder.

## Troubleshooting

> `Note:` If this plugin does not work install [GDToolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit) manually and then add the GDToolkit path in the `addons/formatter.gd` file in line 4 `var gdformatter_path = "<path>"`.
